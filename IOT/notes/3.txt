Peripherial Component Interconnect:
1. it is a computer bus standard developed in 1990s for attaching peripherial devices to the computer motherboard
2. it does data transfer between CPU and the external devices
3. A peripherial device is a device which connects with a computer and does a specific task with the help of it
Key features of PCI :
1. Data transfer method : 
	PCI is a parallel bus that operates synchronously on a single clock signal.
	it supports both 32 bit and 64bit data transfer
	since it is a parallel bus and synchronized , it is much faster
	clock signal : it is the signal which oscillates between the high and the low state . because of which the digital circuit performs in action.
2. bus mastering : 
	allows devices to intitiate data transfer without involving CPU
3. automatic configuration : 
	configures connected devices to work with other PCI components
4. Compatibility : 
	PCI has backward compatibility with some PCI devices
Versions : 
	PCIe : uses serial communication instead of parallel , : low latency , PCIe has replaced PCI after 2007
Applications : 
	desktop computers, 
	graphic cards , sound cards , ssds etc
PCI BUS ARCHITECTURE : 
1. architecture is based upon ISA and VL 
2. PCI provides connection directly to the system memory which improves the performance.
3. it has now 66mhz frequency.
brust mode : allows multiple set of data to be sent
full bus mastering : ability of the devices to reach the processor direclty
