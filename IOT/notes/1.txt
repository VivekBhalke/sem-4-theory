Block diagram of basic organization of computers ? 
1. Organization of computer system has fundamental components and their interconnections which allows them to work together , these components can be divided into hardware and software components:
Hardware Components : 
1. CPU (Central Processing Unit) : 
	it is brain ,
	it has : 
	1. ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) : 
		does all arithmetic and logic operations
	2. Control Unit : 
		it directs the operation of the processes and co-ordinates the activities of other components by fetching interpreting instructions from memory
2. Main Memory or Primary Memory : 
	Commonly known as RAM , 
	holds data and instructions temporarily 
	has series of memory locations each identified by using addresses

				Memory :
		Primary (RAM)			Secondary (ROM)
	DRAM 		SRAM 		PROM 		EPROM
							EEPROM 	UVEPROM

3. Secondary memory devices : 
	store large data , permanently, cheaper than RAM
